Blazewicz, Steven J., Romain L. Barnard, Rebecca A. Daly, and Mary K. Firestone. 2013. ???Evaluating RRNA as an Indicator of Microbial Activity in Environmental Communities: Limitations and Uses.??? The ISME Journal 7 (11): 2061???68. https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2013.102.

(The below is an attempt of testing activity by mapping RNA reads to DNA amplicon OTU centroid sequences. It turned out not to work so well, so instead, do amplification of RNA and DNA separately so you get amplicons of both.

Thureborn, Petter, Yue O.O. Hu, Andrea Franzetti, Sara Sj??ling, and Daniel Lundin. 2016. ???Accumulation of DNA in an Anoxic Sediment ??? RDNA and RRNA Presence of Members of the Microbial Community from Landsort Deep, the Baltic Sea.??? https://doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.2051v1.)
